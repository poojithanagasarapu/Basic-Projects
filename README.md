# Task-1

# Color Detector Identification

Color detection is the method of identifying a color in an image. It is very often used in the field of object recognition and applications such as drawing and editing of images.

## Problem Statement

The color detection is very useful for getting a specific color in the images. There are multiple colos that can be present in a photograph up to 16 million in an RGB spectrum. The project aims that these colors can be detected and identified with accuracy while developing an app for looking interactive colors present in images.

## Key Features 
- Detects colors based on the RGB values in an image.
- Helps users identify colors in an interactive manner.
- Use in every activity related to object recognition, image processing, and digital art as well.

## Why Color Detection?
- A color detector is very essential in the identification of objects.
- It is used in image processing, machine vision, and other designing areas.
- There are tasks that can be made simpler or which cannot be done at all by identifying colors in the visual space and segmenting them.

  
### Dependencies
